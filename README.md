# Scroll-Slambook

# TODO:

1. Making design for slambook (on each page we should have two images with description)
2. Moving this code to SSG so we can generate UI based on images we have given.
3. Designing Cover of the book
4. Changing background of the book
5. Making it responsive so it can be readable and clearly visible. (Including flip animation of book pages)
